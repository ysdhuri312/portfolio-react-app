Hey, welcome to the course. I hope this course provides a great learning experience!

## What is system design?

Before we start this course, let's talk about what even is system design.

System design is the process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data
for a system that satisfies specific requirements. System design meets the needs
of your business or organization through coherent and efficient systems. It requires
a systematic approach to building and engineering systems. A good system design requires
us to think about everything, from infrastructure all the way down to the data and how it's stored.

# IP

An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for _"Internet Protocol"_, which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network. They contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.

## IPv4

The original Internet Protocol is IPv4 which uses a 32-bit numeric dot-decimal notation that only allows for around 4 billion IP addresses. Initially, it was more than enough but as internet adoption grew, we needed something better.

_Example: `102.22.192.181`_

### IPv6

IPv6 is a new protocol that was introduced in 1998. Deployment commenced in the mid-2000s and since the internet users have grown exponentially, it is still ongoing.

This new protocol uses 128-bit alphanumeric hexadecimal notation. This means that IPv6 can provide about ~340e+36 IP addresses. That's more than enough to meet the growing demand for years to come.

_Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`_

## Types

Let's discuss types of IP addresses:

### Public

A public IP address is an address where one primary address is associated with your whole network. In this type of IP address, each of the connected devices has the same IP address.

_Example: IP address provided to your router by the ISP._

### Private

A private IP address is a unique IP number assigned to every device that connects to your internet network, which includes devices like computers, tablets, and smartphones, which are used in your household.

_Example: IP addresses generated by your home router for your devices._

### Static

A static IP address does not change and is one that was manually created, as opposed to having been assigned. These addresses are usually more expensive but are more reliable.

_Example: They are usually used for important things like reliable geo-location services, remote access, server hosting, etc._

### Dynamic

A dynamic IP address changes from time to time and is not always the same. It has been assigned by a [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) server. Dynamic IP addresses are the most common type of internet protocol address. They are cheaper to deploy and allow us to reuse IP addresses within a network as needed.

_Example: They are more commonly used for consumer equipment and personal use._

# OSI Model

The OSI Model is a logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems open to interconnection and communication with other systems. The Open System Interconnection (OSI Model) also defines a logical network and effectively describes computer packet transfer by using various layers of protocols.

The OSI Model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. It's based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.

## Why does the OSI model matter?

The Open System Interconnection (OSI) model has defined the common terminology used in networking discussions and documentation. This allows us to take a very complex communications process apart and evaluate its components.

While this model is not directly implemented in the TCP/IP networks that are most common today, it can still help us do so much more, such as:

- Make troubleshooting easier and help identify threats across the entire stack.
- Encourage hardware manufacturers to create networking products that can communicate with each other over the network.
- Essential for developing a security-first mindset.
- Separate a complex function into simpler components.

## Layers

The seven abstraction layers of the OSI model can be defined as follows, from top to bottom:

![osi-model](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-I/osi-model/osi-model.png)

### Application

This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user. Software applications like web browsers and email clients rely on the application layer to initiate communication. But it should be made clear that client software applications are not part of the application layer, rather the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user. Application layer protocols include HTTP as well as SMTP.

### Presentation

The presentation layer is also called the Translation layer. The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network. The functions of the presentation layer are translation, encryption/decryption, and compression.

### Session

This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices. The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session. The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources. The session layer also synchronizes data transfer with checkpoints.

### Transport

The transport layer (also known as layer 4) is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices. This includes taking data from the session layer and breaking it up into chunks called segments before sending it to the Network layer (layer 3). It is also responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving device into data the session layer can consume.

### Network

The network layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called packets, on the sender's device, and reassembles these packets on the receiving device. The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination this is known as routing. If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary.

### Data Link

The data link layer is very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the same network. The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames.

### Physical

This layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches. This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.

## TCP vs UDP

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol. A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. Overall, UDP is a much faster, simpler, and more efficient protocol, however, retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP.

TCP provides ordered delivery of data from user to server (and vice versa), whereas UDP is not dedicated to end-to-end communications, nor does it check the readiness of the receiver.

| Feature             | TCP                                         | UDP                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Connection          | Requires an established connection          | Connectionless protocol            |
| Guaranteed delivery | Can guarantee delivery of data              | Cannot guarantee delivery of data  |
| Re-transmission     | Re-transmission of lost packets is possible | No re-transmission of lost packets |
| Speed               | Slower than UDP                             | Faster than TCP                    |
| Broadcasting        | Does not support broadcasting               | Supports broadcasting              |
| Use cases           | HTTPS, HTTP, SMTP, POP, FTP, etc            | Video streaming, DNS, VoIP, etc    |

# Domain Name System (DNS)

Earlier we learned about IP addresses that enable every machine to connect with other machines. But as we know humans are more comfortable with names than numbers. It's easier to remember a name like `google.com` than something like `122.250.192.232`.

This brings us to Domain Name System (DNS) which is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system used for translating human-readable domain names to IP addresses.

## How DNS works

![how-dns-works](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-I/domain-name-system/how-dns-works.png)

DNS lookup involves the following eight steps:

1. A client types [example.com](http://example.com) into a web browser, the query travels to the internet and is received by a DNS resolver.
2. The resolver then recursively queries a DNS root nameserver.
3. The root server responds to the resolver with the address of a Top-Level Domain (TLD).
4. The resolver then makes a request to the `.com` TLD.
5. The TLD server then responds with the IP address of the domain's nameserver, [example.com](http://example.com).
6. Lastly, the recursive resolver sends a query to the domain's nameserver.
7. The IP address for [example.com](http://example.com) is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver.
8. The DNS resolver then responds to the web browser with the IP address of the domain requested initially.

Once the IP address has been resolved, the client should be able to request content from the resolved IP address. For example, the resolved IP may return a webpage to be rendered in the browser.

## Record Types

DNS records (aka zone files) are instructions that live in authoritative DNS servers and provide information about a domain including what IP address is associated with that domain and how to handle requests for that domain.

These records consist of a series of text files written in what is known as _DNS syntax_. DNS syntax is just a string of characters used as commands that tell the DNS server what to do. All DNS records also have a _"TTL"_, which stands for time-to-live, and indicates how often a DNS server will refresh that record.

There are more record types but for now, let's look at some of the most commonly used ones:

- **A (Address record)**: This is the record that holds the IP address of a domain.
- **AAAA (IP Version 6 Address record)**: The record that contains the IPv6 address for a domain (as opposed to A records, which stores the IPv4 address).
- **CNAME (Canonical Name record)**: Forwards one domain or subdomain to another domain, does NOT provide an IP address.
- **MX (Mail exchanger record)**: Directs mail to an email server.
- **TXT (Text Record)**: This record lets an admin store text notes in the record. These records are often used for email security.
- **NS (Name Server records)**: Stores the name server for a DNS entry.
- **SOA (Start of Authority)**: Stores admin information about a domain.
- **SRV (Service Location record)**: Specifies a port for specific services.
- **PTR (Reverse-lookup Pointer record)**: Provides a domain name in reverse lookups.
- **CERT (Certificate record)**: Stores public key certificates.

## Subdomains

A subdomain is an additional part of our main domain name. It is commonly used to logically separate a website into sections. We can create multiple subdomains or child domains on the main domain.

For example, `blog.example.com` where `blog` is the subdomain, `example` is the primary domain and `.com` is the top-level domain (TLD). Similar examples can be `support.example.com` or `careers.example.com`.

_Note: Reverse DNS lookups are not universally adopted as they are not critical to the normal function of the internet._

## Examples

These are some widely used managed DNS solutions:

- [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53)
- [Cloudflare DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns)
- [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns)
- [Azure DNS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/dns)
- [NS1](https://ns1.com/products/managed-dns)

## Features

Here are some commonly desired features of load balancers:

- **Autoscaling**: Starting up and shutting down resources in response to demand conditions.
- **Sticky sessions**: The ability to assign the same user or device to the same resource in order to maintain the session state on the resource.
- **Healthchecks**: The ability to determine if a resource is down or performing poorly in order to remove the resource from the load balancing pool.
- **Persistence connections**: Allowing a server to open a persistent connection with a client such as a WebSocket.
- **Encryption**: Handling encrypted connections such as TLS and SSL.
- **Certificates**: Presenting certificates to a client and authentication of client certificates.
- **Compression**: Compression of responses.
- **Caching**: An application-layer load balancer may offer the ability to cache responses.
- **Logging**: Logging of request and response metadata can serve as an important audit trail or source for analytics data.
- **Request tracing**: Assigning each request a unique id for the purposes of logging, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
- **Redirects**: The ability to redirect an incoming request based on factors such as the requested path.
- **Fixed response**: Returning a static response for a request such as an error message.

## Examples

Following are some of the load balancing solutions commonly used in the industry:

- [Amazon Elastic Load Balancing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing)
- [Azure Load Balancing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/load-balancer)
- [GCP Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing)
- [DigitalOcean Load Balancer](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/load-balancer)
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com)
- [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org)

## Components

Here are some common components found across different databases:

### Schema

The role of a schema is to define the shape of a data structure, and specify what kinds of data can go where. Schemas can be strictly enforced across the entire database, loosely enforced on part of the database, or they might not exist at all.

### Table

Each table contains various columns just like in a spreadsheet. A table can have as meager as two columns and upwards of a hundred or more columns, depending upon the kind of information being put in the table.

### Column

A column contains a set of data values of a particular type, one value for each row of the database. A column may contain text values, numbers, enums, timestamps, etc.

### Row

Data in a table is recorded in rows. There can be thousands or millions of rows in a table having any particular information.

## Types

![database-types](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-II/databases-and-dbms/database-types.png)

Below are different types of databases:

- **[SQL](/courses/system-design/sql-databases)**
- **[NoSQL](/courses/system-design/nosql-databases)**
  - Document
  - Key-value
  - Graph
  - Timeseries
  - Wide column
  - Multi-model

SQL and NoSQL databases are broad topics and will be discussed separately in [SQL databases](/courses/system-design/sql-databases) and [NoSQL databases](/courses/system-design/nosql-databases). Learn how they compare to each other in [SQL vs NoSQL databases](/courses/system-design/sql-vs-nosql-databases).

**Examples**

- [Redis](https://redis.io)
- [Memcached](https://memcached.org)
- [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb)
- [Aerospike](https://aerospike.com)

### Graph

A graph database is a NoSQL database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data instead of tables or documents.

The graph relates the data items in the store to a collection of nodes and edges, the edges representing the relationships between the nodes. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly and, in many cases, retrieved with one operation.

**Advantages**

- Query speed
- Agile and flexible
- Explicit data representation

**Disadvantages**

- Complex
- No standardized query language

**Use cases**

- Fraud detection
- Recommendation engines
- Social networks
- Network mapping

**Examples**

- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com)
- [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com)
- [Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune)
- [JanusGraph](https://janusgraph.org)

**Examples**

- [BigTable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable)
- [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org)
- [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com)

### Multi-model

Multi-model databases combine different database models (i.e. relational, graph, key-value, document, etc.) into a single, integrated backend. This means they can accommodate various data types, indexes, queries, and store data in more than one model.

**Advantages**

- Flexibility
- Suitable for complex projects
- Data consistent

**Disadvantages**

- Complex
- Less mature

**Examples**

- [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com)
- [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cosmos-db)
- [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com)

## Master-Master Replication

Both masters serve reads/writes and coordinate with each other. If either master goes down, the system can continue to operate with both reads and writes.

![master-master-replication](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-II/database-replication/master-master-replication.png)

### Advantages

- Applications can read from both masters.
- Distributes write load across both master nodes.
- Simple, automatic, and quick failover.

### Disadvantages

- Not as simple as master-slave to configure and deploy.
- Either loosely consistent or have increased write latency due to synchronization.
- Conflict resolution comes into play as more write nodes are added and as latency increases.

## Virtual Nodes

In order to ensure a more evenly distributed load, we can introduce the idea of a virtual node, sometimes also referred to as a VNode.

Instead of assigning a single position to a node, the hash range is divided into multiple smaller ranges, and each physical node is assigned several of these smaller ranges. Each of these subranges is considered a VNode. Hence, virtual nodes are basically existing physical nodes mapped multiple times across the hash ring to minimize changes to a node's assigned range.

![virtual-nodes](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-II/consistent-hashing/virtual-nodes.png)

For this, we can use `k` number of hash functions.

$$
\begin{align*}
& Hash_1(key_1) = P_1 \\
& Hash_2(key_2) = P_2 \\
& Hash_3(key_3) = P_3 \\
& . . . \\
& Hash_k(key_n) = P_{m-1}
\end{align*}
$$

Where,

`key`: Request/Node ID or IP.

`k`: Number of hash functions.

`P`: Position on the hash ring.

`m`: Total range of the hash ring.

As VNodes help spread the load more evenly across the physical nodes on the cluster by dividing the hash ranges into smaller subranges, this speeds up the re-balancing process after adding or removing nodes. This also helps us reduce the probability of hotspots.

# API Gateway

The API Gateway is an API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services. It is a single entry point into a system that encapsulates the internal system architecture and provides an API that is tailored to each client. It also has other responsibilities such as authentication, monitoring, load balancing, caching, throttling, logging, etc.

![api-gateway](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-III/api-gateway/api-gateway.png)

## Why do we need an API Gateway?

The granularity of APIs provided by microservices is often different than what a client needs. Microservices typically provide fine-grained APIs, which means that clients need to interact with multiple services. Hence, an API gateway can provide a single entry point for all clients with some additional features and better management.

## Features

Below are some desired features of an API Gateway:

- Authentication and Authorization
- [Service discovery](/courses/system-design/service-discovery)
- [Reverse Proxy](/courses/system-design/proxy#reverse-proxy)
- [Caching](/courses/system-design/caching)
- Security
- Retry and [Circuit breaking](/courses/system-design/circuit-breaker)
- [Load balancing](/courses/system-design/load-balancing)
- Logging, Tracing
- API composition
- [Rate limiting](/courses/system-design/rate-limiting) and throttling
- Versioning
- Routing
- IP whitelisting or blacklisting

## Advantages

Let's look at some advantages of using an API Gateway:

- Encapsulates the internal structure of an API.
- Provides a centralized view of the API.
- Simplifies the client code.
- Monitoring, analytics, tracing, and other such features.

## Disadvantages

Here are some possible disadvantages of an API Gateway:

- Possible single point of failure.
- Might impact performance.
- Can become a bottleneck if not scaled properly.
- Configuration can be challenging.

### Example

Here's a basic example of a gRPC service defined in a `*.proto` file. Using this definition, we can easily code generate the `HelloService` service in the programming language of our choice.

```protobuf
service HelloService {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloResponse);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string greeting = 1;
}

message HelloResponse {
  string reply = 1;
}
```

## REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC

Now that we know how these API designing techniques work, let's compare them based on the following parameters:

- Will it cause tight coupling?
- How _chatty_ (distinct API calls to get needed information) are the APIs?
- What's the performance like?
- How complex is it to integrate?
- How well does the caching work?
- Built-in tooling and code generation?
- What's API discoverability like?
- How easy is it to version APIs?

| Type    | Coupling | Chattiness | Performance | Complexity | Caching | Codegen | Discoverability | Versioning |
| ------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| REST    | Low      | High       | Good        | Medium     | Great   | Bad     | Good            | Easy       |
| GraphQL | Medium   | Low        | Good        | High       | Custom  | Good    | Good            | Custom     |
| gRPC    | High     | Medium     | Great       | Low        | Custom  | Great   | Bad             | Hard       |

# URL Shortener

Let's design a URL shortener, similar to services like [Bitly](https://bitly.com), [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/app).

## What is a URL Shortener?

A URL shortener service creates an alias or a short URL for a long URL. Users are redirected to the original URL when they visit these short links.

For example, the following long URL can be changed to a shorter URL.

**Long URL**: [https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/url-shortener](/courses/system-design/url-shortener)

**Short URL**: [https://bit.ly/3I71d3o](https://bit.ly/3I71d3o)

## Why do we need a URL shortener?

URL shortener saves space in general when we are sharing URLs. Users are also less likely to mistype shorter URLs. Moreover, we can also optimize links across devices, this allows us to track individual links.

## Requirements

Our URL shortening system should meet the following requirements:

### Functional requirements

- Given a URL, our service should generate a _shorter and unique_ alias for it.
- Users should be redirected to the original URL when they visit the short link.
- Links should expire after a default timespan.

### Non-functional requirements

- High availability with minimal latency.
- The system should be scalable and efficient.

### Extended requirements

- Prevent abuse of services.
- Record analytics and metrics for redirections.

## Estimation and Constraints

Let's start with the estimation and constraints.

_Note: Make sure to check any scale or traffic related assumptions with your interviewer._

### Traffic

This will be a read-heavy system, so let's assume a `100:1` read/write ratio with 100 million links generated per month.

**Reads/Writes Per month**

For reads per month:

$$
100 \times 100 \space million = 10 \space billion/month
$$

Similarly for writes:

$$
1 \times 100 \space million = 100 \space million/month
$$

**What would be Requests Per Second (RPS) for our system?**

100 million requests per month translate into 40 requests per second.

$$
\frac{100 \space million}{(30 \space days \times 24 \space hrs \times 3600 \space seconds)} = \sim 40 \space URLs/second
$$

And with a `100:1` read/write ratio, the number of redirections will be:

$$
100 \times 40 \space URLs/second = 4000 \space requests/second
$$

### Bandwidth

Since we expect about 40 URLs every second, and if we assume each request is of size 500 bytes then the total incoming data for write requests would be:

$$
40 \times 500 \space bytes = 20 \space KB/second
$$

Similarly, for the read requests, since we expect about 4K redirections, the total outgoing data would be:

$$
4000 \space URLs/second \times 500 \space bytes = \sim 2 \space MB/second
$$

### Storage

For storage, we will assume we store each link or record in our database for 10 years. Since we expect around 100M new requests every month, the total number of records we will need to store would be:

$$
100 \space million \times 10\space years \times 12 \space months = 12 \space billion
$$

Like earlier, if we assume each stored record will be approximately 500 bytes. We will need around 6TB of storage:

$$
12 \space billion \times 500 \space bytes = 6 \space TB
$$

### Cache

For caching, we will follow the classic [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) also known as the 80/20 rule. This means that 80% of the requests are for 20% of the data, so we can cache around 20% of our requests.

Since we get around 4K read or redirection requests each second, this translates into 350M requests per day.

$$
4000 \space URLs/second \times 24 \space hours \times 3600 \space seconds = \sim 350 \space million \space requests/day
$$

Hence, we will need around 35GB of memory per day.

$$
20 \space percent \times 350 \space million \times 500 \space bytes = 35 \space GB/day
$$

### High-level estimate

Here is our high-level estimate:

| Type                 | Estimate   |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Writes (New URLs)    | 40/s       |
| Reads (Redirection)  | 4K/s       |
| Bandwidth (Incoming) | 20 KB/s    |
| Bandwidth (Outgoing) | 2 MB/s     |
| Storage (10 years)   | 6 TB       |
| Memory (Caching)     | ~35 GB/day |

## Data model design

Next, we will focus on the data model design. Here is our database schema:

![url-shortener-datamodel](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-V/url-shortener/url-shortener-datamodel.png)

Initially, we can get started with just two tables:

**users**

Stores user's details such as `name`, `email`, `createdAt`, etc.

**urls**

Contains the new short URL's properties such as `expiration`, `hash`, `originalURL`, and `userID` of the user who created the short URL. We can also use the `hash` column as an [index](/courses/system-design/indexes) to improve the query performance.

### What kind of database should we use?

Since the data is not strongly relational, NoSQL databases such as [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb), [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html), or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) will be a better choice here, if we do decide to use an SQL database then we can use something like [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/azure-sql/database) or [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds).

_For more details, refer to [SQL vs NoSQL](/courses/system-design/sql-vs-nosql-databases)._

## API design

Let us do a basic API design for our services:

### Create URL

This API should create a new short URL in our system given an original URL.

```tsx
createURL(apiKey: string, originalURL: string, expiration?: Date): string
```

**Parameters**

API Key (`string`): API key provided by the user.

Original URL (`string`): Original URL to be shortened.

Expiration (`Date`): Expiration date of the new URL _(optional)_.

**Returns**

Short URL (`string`): New shortened URL.

### Get URL

This API should retrieve the original URL from a given short URL.

```tsx
getURL(apiKey: string, shortURL: string): string
```

**Parameters**

API Key (`string`): API key provided by the user.

Short URL (`string`): Short URL mapped to the original URL.

**Returns**

Original URL (`string`): Original URL to be retrieved.

### Delete URL

This API should delete a given shortURL from our system.

```tsx
deleteURL(apiKey: string, shortURL: string): boolean
```

**Parameters**

API Key (`string`): API key provided by the user.

Short URL (`string`): Short URL to be deleted.

**Returns**

### Why do we need an API key?

As you must've noticed, we're using an API key to prevent abuse of our services. Using this API key we can limit the users to a certain number of requests per second or minute. This is quite a standard practice for developer APIs and should cover our extended requirement.

## High-level design

Now let us do a high-level design of our system.

### URL Encoding

Our system's primary goal is to shorten a given URL, let's look at different approaches:

**Base62 Approach**

In this approach, we can encode the original URL using [Base62](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base62) which consists of the capital letters A-Z, the lower case letters a-z, and the numbers 0-9.

$$
Number \space of \space URLs = 62^N
$$

Where,

`N`: Number of characters in the generated URL.

So, if we want to generate a URL that is 7 characters long, we will generate ~3.5 trillion different URLs.

$$
\begin{gather*}
62^5 = \sim 916 \space million \space URLs \\
62^6 = \sim 56.8 \space billion \space URLs \\
62^7 = \sim 3.5 \space trillion \space URLs
\end{gather*}
$$

This is the simplest solution here, but it does not guarantee non-duplicate or collision-resistant keys.

**MD5 Approach**

The [MD5 message-digest algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value (or 32 hexadecimal digits). We can use these 32 hexadecimal digits for generating 7 characters long URL.

$$
MD5(original\_url) \rightarrow base62encode \rightarrow hash
$$

However, this creates a new issue for us, which is duplication and collision. We can try to re-compute the hash until we find a unique one but that will increase the overhead of our systems. It's better to look for more scalable approaches.

**Counter Approach**

In this approach, we will start with a single server which will maintain the count of the keys generated. Once our service receives a request, it can reach out to the counter which returns a unique number and increments the counter. When the next request comes the counter again returns the unique number and this goes on.

$$
Counter(0-3.5 \space trillion) \rightarrow base62encode \rightarrow hash
$$

The problem with this approach is that it can quickly become a single point for failure. And if we run multiple instances of the counter we can have collision as it's essentially a distributed system.

To solve this issue we can use a distributed system manager such as [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org) which can provide distributed synchronization. Zookeeper can maintain multiple ranges for our servers.

$$
\begin{align*}
& Range \space 1: \space 1 \rightarrow 1,000,000 \\
& Range \space 2: \space 1,000,001 \rightarrow 2,000,000 \\
& Range \space 3: \space 2,000,001 \rightarrow 3,000,000 \\
& ...
\end{align*}
$$

Once a server reaches its maximum range Zookeeper will assign an unused counter range to the new server. This approach can guarantee non-duplicate and collision-resistant URLs. Also, we can run multiple instances of Zookeeper to remove the single point of failure.

### Key Generation Service (KGS)

As we discussed, generating a unique key at scale without duplication and collisions can be a bit of a challenge. To solve this problem, we can create a standalone Key Generation Service (KGS) that generates a unique key ahead of time and stores it in a separate database for later use. This approach can make things simple for us.

**How to handle concurrent access?**

Once the key is used, we can mark it in the database to make sure we don't reuse it, however, if there are multiple server instances reading data concurrently, two or more servers might try to use the same key.

The easiest way to solve this would be to store keys in two tables. As soon as a key is used, we move it to a separate table with appropriate locking in place. Also, to improve reads, we can keep some of the keys in memory.

**KGS database estimations**

As per our discussion, we can generate up to ~56.8 billion unique 6 character long keys which will result in us having to store 300 GB of keys.

$$
6 \space characters \times 56.8 \space billion = \sim 390 \space GB
$$

While 390 GB seems like a lot for this simple use case, it is important to remember this is for the entirety of our service lifetime and the size of the keys database would not increase like our main database.

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

[Content Delivery Network (CDN)](/courses/system-design/content-delivery-network) increases content availability and redundancy while reducing bandwidth costs. Generally, static files such as images, and videos are served from CDN. We can use services like [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront) or [Cloudflare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn) for this use case.

### API gateway

Since we will be using multiple protocols like HTTP, WebSocket, TCP/IP, deploying multiple L4 (transport layer) or L7 (application layer) type load balancers separately for each protocol will be expensive. Instead, we can use an [API Gateway](/courses/system-design/api-gateway) that supports multiple protocols without any issues.

API Gateway can also offer other features such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, throttling, and API versioning which will improve the quality of our services.

We can use services like [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway) or [Azure API Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/api-management) for this use case.

## Identify and resolve bottlenecks

![whatsapp-advanced-design](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-V/whatsapp/whatsapp-advanced-design.png)

Let us identify and resolve bottlenecks such as single points of failure in our design:

- "What if one of our services crashes?"
- "How will we distribute our traffic between our components?"
- "How can we reduce the load on our database?"
- "How to improve the availability of our cache?"
- "Wouldn't API Gateway be a single point of failure?"
- "How can we make our notification system more robust?"
- "How can we reduce media storage costs"?
- "Does chat service has too much responsibility?"

To make our system more resilient we can do the following:

- Running multiple instances of each of our services.
- Introducing [load balancers](/courses/system-design/load-balancing) between clients, servers, databases, and cache servers.
- Using multiple read replicas for our databases.
- Multiple instances and replicas for our distributed cache.
- We can have a standby replica of our API Gateway.
- Exactly once delivery and message ordering is challenging in a distributed system, we can use a dedicated [message broker](/courses/system-design/message-brokers) such as [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) or [NATS](https://nats.io) to make our notification system more robust.
- We can add media processing and compression capabilities to the media service to compress large files similar to WhatsApp which will save a lot of storage space and reduce cost.
- We can create a group service separate from the chat service to further decouple our services.

## Conclusion

A large amount of work, unfamiliar technology, tests, code reviews, and a tight deadline added a challenge to the project. It has been one of the most intense projects for me so far. And it's cool that we were able to work out all the issues and launch the project on time.
